          The purpose of this cookie policy is to inform you about the types of
          cookies we use on this website, and via our Service. Click to view our
          privacy policy. Below is a summary of the types of cookie that may be
          set and their function. If you have any questions about our privacy
          practices, please email us at enquiry@pricebay.com.ng.<br />
          By 'our/we/us/ours' we mean PriceBay and its wholly and partly owned
          subsidiaries, any company in which it has an interest by way of

          <h3 className="ui header">What is a cookie?</h3>
          "Cookies" are small text files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on
          your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, mobile or
          other PDA) when you visit a website or certain emails you open. You
          can turn cookies off but if you do this you may not be able to use all
          services on websites and you might see more alternative advertising,
          as we will not be able to limit what you see using cookies. There are
          many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to
          address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or
          otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or
          any other PII. <br />PriceBay does not and cannot use Cookies or web
          beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. Cookies are passive and
          just used for transferring that anonymous information. Why do we use
          cookies? Cookies allow the server to recognise you when you revisit.
          Websites are able to read and write these files, allowing them to
          store things like personalisation details or user preferences. They
          are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide business and marketing information
          to the owners of the site. Cookies are used to improve the experience
          web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a
          web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct
          click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total
          reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display.
          Cookies are also used for statistical purposes to track how many
          individual unique users we have and how often they visit our websites
          and to generate statistical cookies to track advertising impressions
          and conversions. There is further information if you click here:
          www.youronlinechoices.eu. We will use the data that we collect through
          our use of these cookies to ensure that you see relevant and useful
          adverts when you visit our Web site and/or use our services. Our
          Cookies Policy Here is a list of all the cookies that are set and how
          we use them: <br />
          <b>SESSION COOKIES</b>
          <br /> Session cookies are used only during your visit to the Sites
          and are erased once you close your browser;.<br />
          <b>PERSISTENT COOKIES</b> <br />Persistent cookies remain on your
          browser for a period of time, usually for several years from your last
          visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits
          to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites..<br />
          <b>ANONYMOUS ANALYTICS COOKIES </b>
          <br /> Every time a user visits our website, web analytics software
          provided by a third party generates an anonymous analytics cookie.
          This cookie can tell us whether or not the site you are viewing has
          been visited before. It allows us to track such things as how many
          individual users we have and which browsers users are utilising. We
          have turned on Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to
          get an idea of our demographics and users' interests.<br />{" "}
          <b>ADVERTISING COOKIES</b>
          <br /> Sometimes we need to know whether or not you have seen an
          advert or a type of advert or how long it has been since you saw the
          advert. In order to do this, we place a cookie on your machine when
          advertising is shown. We may use cookies to more accurately target
          advertising to you. These cookies are anonymous. We also set anonymous
          cookies to users on certain third party sites. If you receive one of
          those cookies, we may then use it to identify you as having visited
          that site if you later visit another site. Based on this information
          we may serve targeted advertising. Our cookies do not store sensitive
          information such as your name and address. Alternatively, see below
          specific information about how to enable or disable cookies. Most
          Internet browsers give you the option of adjusting their settings
          allow you to automatically refuse cookies either generally or from
          specific sites. To adjust these settings, we would recommend that you
          contact the supplier of you browser. <br />
